In order to obtain gapped V sequences that are required for the immcantation pipeline, the following procedure was followed:

- The nucleotide sequences of V genes obtained by PacBio sequencing of a rhesus macaque genome was translated using the transeq tool
  in the EMBOSS 6.6.0.0 software suite [1]. 
- The protein sequences were submitted to the IMGT DomainGapAlign tool [2, 3]  to obtain gapped V sequences for Macaca mulatta. 
  Some of the sequences were manually edited.    
- Corresponding gaps were introduced in the nucleotide sequences and the positions for framework (FR) and complementarity-determining
  regions (CDR) regions determined. 
- The headers were modified to resemble the IMGT headers.These sequences required by MakeDb.py are present in: 
  slow_delivery_immunization/databases/fasta_immcantation/
- The positions for the FR and CDR3 are included in the 
  slow_delivery_immunization/databases/igblast_files/internal_data/rhesus_monkey.ndm.imgt & 
  slow_delivery_immunization/databases/igblast_files/internal_data/rhesus_monkey.pdm.imgt
- The database sequences for igblast are in: slow_delivery_immunization/databases/igblast_files/internal_data/
- The optional file for igblast: slow_delivery_immunization/databases/igblast_files/optional_file/rhesus_monkey_gl.aux
- The IGHD sequences were obtained from http://www.imgt.org/vquest/refseqh.html
